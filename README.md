# SMS Weather Summary

<hr>

This project was created as part of [Dr. Angela Yu's Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and subsequently expanded upon.

When linked to a valid [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) API key, will send an SMS message to the provided phone numbers, listing the weather for the following day.

The current version of this program identifies the following day's weather description and feels like temperature for the morning, day, evening, and night.
